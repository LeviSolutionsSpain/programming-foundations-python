# programming-foundations-python
A structured exploration of programming fundamentals in Python, focused on mental models, state, control flow, abstraction, and error.

# About this repository

This repository documents how I approach programming fundamentals in Python.
It focuses on concepts such as state, control flow, abstraction, mutability, and error handling, using small, isolated examples rather than applications or frameworks.

The material is intentionally incomplete and non-linear. Its purpose is to make core ideas explicit and inspectable, not to serve as a full course.

If this way of reasoning resonates with you and you’re looking for a fully structured path — with deliberate sequencing, progressively harder exercises, and feedback — I’m developing a complete course here: https://levieducation.com/

# How to read this repository

Run the files.

Change the code.

Observe how meaning depends on execution order and state.

Treat confusion as a signal to slow down, not to skip ahead.
