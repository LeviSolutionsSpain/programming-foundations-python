A structured exploration of programming fundamentals in Python, focused on mental models, state, control flow, and abstraction.

# About this repository

This repository is a public exploration of how I think about programming fundamentals in Python: state, control flow, abstraction, and error. It is intentionally incomplete and non-linear. If this way of reasoning resonates with you and you’re looking for a fully structured path — with deliberate sequencing, progressively harder exercises, and feedback — I’m developing a complete course here: [link to course website].
